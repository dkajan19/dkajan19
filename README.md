👋 **Hi there, welcome to my profile**


My name is Denis, and I enjoy developing apps and finding ways to simplify daily tasks through code. I'm usually working on something new, mostly for the fun of it or simply to see if I can make a process more efficient.

If you are here for the first time, feel free to check out my work in my [repositories](https://github.com/dkajan19?tab=repositories) here on GitHub.

When I'm not writing code, I'm likely reading, gaming, or successfully wasting an impressive amount of time on YouTube. Most of my projects are built using:

If you find my tools useful or want to support my "YouTube research" and coffee intake, you can buy me a coffee here:
